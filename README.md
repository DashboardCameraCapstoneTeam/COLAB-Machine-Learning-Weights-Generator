# COLAB-Machine-Learning-Weights-Generator

Roboflow is a Computer Vision developer framework for better data collection to preprocessing, and model training techniques. Roboflow has public datasets readily available to users and has access for users to upload their own custom data also. This script, created with some datasets from Robo is used to generate Machine Learning model Weights for a YOLOv5 Algorithm.
